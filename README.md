Hello ,I am Papil Kamdi and this project is Website having some basic functionality  .
It's basically a products page in which the data is presented in tabular format . 
so , on landing page you will see a login page and if haven't signed-In before you have to sign-in first .

After login you will be taken to a home page where you will see the products data in a tabular format .
if the data didn't came please wait or refresh the page as I have used a fakeAPI so some time it takes time . 
On the same page you get a search bar , Drop-down and a Switch button .
Each component is totally  functional .
